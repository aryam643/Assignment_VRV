### Log Analyzer

---

#### **Overview**
This script processes web server log files to extract insights about:
1. **Request counts by IP address**: Tracks the number of requests each IP has made.
2. **Most frequently accessed endpoint**: Identifies the endpoint accessed the most.
3. **Suspicious activity detection**: Flags IP addresses with repeated failed login attempts.

The analysis results are displayed in the terminal and saved to a CSV file.

---

#### **Features**
1. **IP Address Analysis**: Counts and ranks IP addresses by the number of requests made.
2. **Endpoint Analysis**: Identifies the most accessed endpoint along with its access count.
3. **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Detects suspicious behavior (e.g., multiple failed login attempts from the same IP).
4. **CSV Output**: Results are saved in a structured CSV file (`log_analysis.csv`).

---

#### **Requirements**
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
- **Input File**: A log file (e.g., `sample.log`) formatted in the common web server log format.

---

#### **Input File Format**
The log file should follow the format:
```
<IP Address> - - [<Timestamp>] "<HTTP Method> <Endpoint> <Protocol>" <Status Code> <Response Size> <Optional Message>
```
Example:
```
192.168.1.1 - - [03/Dec/2024:10:12:34 +0000] "GET /home HTTP/1.1" 200 512
203.0.113.5 - - [03/Dec/2024:10:12:35 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 401 128 "Invalid credentials"
```

---

#### **Usage Instructions**

1. **Prepare the Input File**:
   - Place your log file in the same directory as the script and name it `sample.log`.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Save the script as `log_analyzer.py`.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.
   - Run the script with:
     ```bash
     python log_analyzer.py
     ```

3. **View Results**:
   - **Terminal**: The results will be printed, including:
     - IP request counts.
     - Most frequently accessed endpoint.
     - Suspicious activity report.
   - **CSV File**: Results will be saved to `log_analysis.csv` in the same directory.

#### **Output Format**

1. **Terminal Output**:
   Example:
   ```
   IP Address           Request Count
   203.0.113.5          8
   198.51.100.23        8
   192.168.1.1          7
   10.0.0.2             6
   192.168.1.100        5

   Most Frequently Accessed Endpoint:
   /login (Accessed 13 times)

   Suspicious Activity Detected:
   - 203.0.113.5
   - 192.168.1.100

   Results saved to 'log_analysis.csv'.
   ```

2. **CSV File**:
   The CSV file (`log_analysis.csv`) has the following structure:
   ```
   IP Address,Request Count
   <IP1>,<Count1>
   <IP2>,<Count2>
   ...

   Most Frequently Accessed Endpoint,Access Count
   <Endpoint>,<Count>

   Suspicious IP Addresses
   <IP1>
   <IP2>
   ...
   ```

---

#### **Customization**
- To change the input file name, modify the `input_file` variable in the script:
  ```python
  input_file = "your_log_file_name.log"
  ```
- To save the output to a different CSV file, change the `output_file` variable:
  ```python
  output_file = "your_output_file_name.csv"
  ```

---

#### **Evaluation Criteria**
This script fulfills the following evaluation requirements:

1. **Functionality**:
   - Processes the log file correctly and fulfills all requirements:
     - Counts IP requests.
     - Identifies the most accessed endpoint.
     - Detects suspicious activity.

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Modular, readable, and well-commented code.
   - Adheres to Python best practices.

3. **Performance**:
   - Efficient processing using `collections.Counter` for counting operations.
   - Scales to larger log files without performance degradation.

4. **Output**:
   - Correctly formatted output displayed in the terminal.
   - Results saved in a structured CSV file (`log_analysis.csv`).

---

#### **Error Handling**
- If the input log file (`sample.log`) is missing, the script displays an error:
  ```
  Error: File 'sample.log' not found. Please ensure it exists in the same directory.
  ```
